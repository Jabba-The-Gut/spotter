# Project Notes

- as GUI framework for python PyQT5 is a good choice, as it is cross platform, free and powerful
- fbs (https://build-system.fman.io) is a build system for GUI Apps that use PyQT
- i don't need to extend spotdl (https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader, https://spotdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#), i can just include it as module in
my program
- spotify has a web API that can be used to read all data of spotify (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/). 
And there do also exist python modules such as Spotipy (https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.13.0/)
